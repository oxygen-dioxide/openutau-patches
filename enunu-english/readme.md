# Patch files for enunu English 
Enunu English voicebanks support not only English songs but also Japanese songs. However, in OpenUTAU, users have to create two seperate tracks using different phonemizers, if their songs contain both English and Japanese lyrics. This patch allow users to synthesize English and Japanese lyrics in one track.

## How to use
1. Download [arpasing.yaml](arpasing.yaml) and put it into your voicebank's folder.
2. Use ENUNU EN phonemizer.
3. Enjoy.

## For Voicebank Developers
If you are a voicebank developer, feel free to ship this file with your voicebanks.
